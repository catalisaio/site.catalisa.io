1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:03,119
All right. Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today, we're
going to dig into something, uh,

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,899
well, it sounds pretty techy at first.
But it actually affects

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,360
how, like, pretty much every business works,
especially in finance. We're talking about

4
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:12,759
composable business. You know, you sent over a bunch of
really interesting stuff about this.

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,620
There's info on this platform, Catalisa, that uses these
ideas and also some good explanations of

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,159
what composability even is, plus how these
low-code and no-code tools fit in.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,139
So I guess our mission today is to, like,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,099
cut through all the fancy terms and figure out what
composable business really means,

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,819
you know, for regular people, and also why it might totally
change how we think about tech in the future.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,659
Yeah. Definitely. We've got a lot of good
stuff to work with here. The

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,780
Catalisa product presentation gives us the rundown
on what their platform's all about,

12
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,879
and then that Composable Business
101 from Quixey,

13
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:48,319
that lays out all the basic
ideas really well.

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,340
Oh, and we've also got a, a little bit about something
called Decision Model Annotation, plus

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,199
Gartner's thoughts on low-code platforms and that
Repositorio de Conhecimento Catalisa, which is, like,

16
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,759
their big-picture vision. It's a pretty complete look
at this whole, uh, changing world.

17
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,079
For sure. So

18
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,159
why should anyone care about this?

19
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,059
Well,

20
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,279
think about how fast things change these days.
Doesn't matter what industry you're in.

21
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:14,299
Being able to adapt is, like, the
most important thing.

22
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,019
Composable business gives you a way to actually
build that adaptability into a company.

23
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,319
It's like taking these huge, complicated systems and breaking
them down into smaller pieces that you can,

24
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:29,439
like, swap in and out as needed. It's almost like instead of
having this one giant piece of software that

25
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:31,619
does everything, you've got
something more like

26
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:33,639
the apps on your phone. You can add new

27
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:36,539
ones, delete the ones you don't need, and
arrange them however you want.

28
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:36,859
Hmm.

29
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,959
If you get this concept, it's like
having a superpower

30
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,999
for figuring out how any business, even yours, can stay
ahead of the curve and keep innovating.

31
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,739
Okay, so enough intro. What is composable business?
Like, if you had to explain it simply?

32
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,999
So, the main idea is basically like you were saying.
You take a business and you break down

33
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,539
all the different things it does, like

34
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,659
processing payments, keeping track
of customer info,

35
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:02,099
approving loans, that sort of thing, into these
separate modules that can work on their own.

36
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:06,259
It's kind of like imagine a set of
super high-tech Legos.

37
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:06,619
Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:10,479
Quixey actually explains the benefits of this really
well. They talk about flexibility,

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,879
which means being able to adjust to, like,

40
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:17,259
new stuff that's happening in the market or
what customers want way faster.

41
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,459
And then there's agility, which means being able
to react super quickly to any

42
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,079
good or bad things that come up. And scaling up your
business becomes easier too, because you're just

43
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:30,779
adding or changing these individual components instead of
having to rebuild this whole massive system.

44
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,999
It can even, like, give different teams
within a company the

45
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,639
power to come up with new stuff without

46
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:39,019
stepping on each other's toes. And in the end, it
makes a whole company tougher,

47
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,919
able to handle any problems that pop up.

48
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,759
I really like that Lego blocks idea.

49
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:46,299
Gartner actually adds a few more
interesting points to this.

50
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,099
They talk about modularity, which we already
mentioned. That's about breaking things down.

51
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:50,379
Huh.

52
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,559
But then they also say these components
need to be discoverable,

53
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:58,259
which means everyone in the company needs to be able to
find them and understand what they do easily.

54
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:58,339
Yeah.

55
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:01,439
It's like having a library of parts, but
with really good instructions.

56
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,859
That seems super important if you
want to move fast.

57
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,359
Oh, totally. If you can't find the pieces
and figure out how they

58
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,099
work, then you're not going to be able
to reuse them very well.

59
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,859
Gartner also talks about orchestration.

60
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,299
That means having the right leaders and systems in place to
actually connect and manage all these different

61
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:23,439
modules, so you can create these smooth, seamless
processes. You can think of it as, like,

62
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,899
the instruction manual and the project
manager for your Lego masterpiece.

63
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:28,079
Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,779
And last but not least, they
emphasize autonomy,

65
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,019
which means giving each of these pieces the freedom to do
its own thing without being tied too closely

66
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,719
to the other parts of the system. This makes the whole
system stronger, because if one piece breaks,

67
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,439
it's less likely to bring the whole
thing crashing down.

68
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,919
Right. So it's not enough, just
have the pieces.

69
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,879
They need to be easy to find, they need to connect properly,
and they need to be able to work on their own.

70
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,159
Hmm.

71
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:56,459
Now, let's talk about Catalisa specifically. How do
they put these principles into practice?

72
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:00,839
Well, their building blocks for financial services are,
like, a perfect example of modularity.

73
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:04,139
They're these pre-made functions for
things like, you know,

74
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,339
managing accounts, processing payments,
handling loans, all that stuff.

75
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,779
And when they talk about
orchestrations on their

76
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:15,879
platform, which is where you visually connect these
blocks to make specific workflows, like say,

77
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,079
the process for signing up a new customer,

78
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,479
well, that's exactly Gartner's orchestration

79
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,879
principle in action. You're basically
creating a visual map of

80
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,299
how these independent components
work together.

81
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,699
Okay. So we're starting to see how
this works for real.

82
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:31,999
Now, Quixey takes this whole idea of
composable business

83
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,659
and breaks it down into three main
building blocks of its own,

84
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,039
kind of like a meta-level of Lego blocks, if
you will. What are those?

85
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,739
Hmm. The first one they call
composable thinking,

86
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:47,359
and this is a really interesting shift in how
people think about things.

87
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,359
It's the idea that anything can be
composable. Like,

88
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:54,819
you should always be looking for ways to break down
problems and solutions into these smaller,

89
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:59,039
reusable parts. It encourages people to share
info and look for inspiration,

90
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:03,899
both inside and outside the company. Like, imagine you're
trying to make your customer service better.

91
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,499
Composable thinking might mean looking at how
other departments in your company

92
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,759
handle customer interactions, or even how

93
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,439
businesses in completely different
industries deal with similar issues.

94
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:17,519
It's about being flexible and responsive
right from the get-go.

95
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,759
So it's not just about the technology itself. It's
about a whole new way of thinking

96
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,379
about challenges in business. What's
the next building block?

97
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,559
The second one is composable
business architecture.

98
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,899
This is all about designing the structure of your whole
business in a way that makes it flexible and strong.

99
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,559
Quixey talks about three main parts here,

100
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,039
engagement, which is how you connect with
customers and partners,

101
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,339
technology, which is all the systems
and tools you use,

102
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:47,799
and capability, which means the skills and
processes your company has.

103
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,239
It's not about throwing away your current

104
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:55,759
setup. It's more like having a plan for figuring out where you
can make things more modular, so you can adapt

105
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:57,679
when all this digital stuff changes.

106
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:02,579
It helps you decide where to invest in new tech and how
to structure your teams and processes.

107
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,259
That makes a lot of sense. It's like having a blueprint for
making a company that can bend without breaking.

108
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,339
And what about that last building block?

109
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,859
Okay. The final one is composable technology. This is
where the actual tools and platforms come in.

110
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:20,339
It's about using tech that's already modular, reusable,
and can connect with other things easily.

111
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,559
We're talking about things like APIs.

112
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,539
Those are application programming interfaces, which let
different systems talk to each other.

113
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,399
Microservices, those are, like,
mini-programs that work on their own.

114
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,519
And of course, low-code platforms like
Quixey and Catalisa Studio,

115
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:38,999
which let you build and connect all these components
visually without writing tons of code.

116
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:44,559
These technologies are, like, the actual bricks and
connectors that make composable business possible.

117
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:49,639
So composable technology gives you the actual stuff to build
with. Okay. Let's bring it back to Catalisa.

118
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,039
How does their platform specifically help make
composable business a reality in finance?

119
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,959
So Catalisa built their platform from the ground up to
be a platform as a service, or Paas.

120
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,679
Basically, it's like giving a
financial institution

121
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,739
all the infrastructure and tools they need in
a ready-to-use online space.

122
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,339
Their main focus is helping these companies become more
adaptable and modernize everything they do,

123
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:18,039
which is a big challenge, because finance is so
complicated, and there are so many regulations.

124
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:21,879
Their whole Lego banking concept is really
important here. They're talking about

125
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:26,979
building entire financial products and services using
these pre-made, standardized modules.

126
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,459
And Catalisa Studio is the visual
workspace that lets you do all

127
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,859
that. You can connect these modules and
create really complex workflows,

128
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,139
and you don't need to be a coding
whiz to do it.

129
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,039
So what are some of the actual benefits that companies in
finance get when they use Catalisa Studio?

130
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:45,985
One of the biggest things they talk about is how
much faster they can develop things.

131
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:49,505
Because you're using pre-built components
and a drag-and-drop system,

132
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:55,706
you can get new features and products out there way faster than
if you were using older development methods.

133
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:59,525
It also makes it so that anyone in the company
can contribute to innovation.

134
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:03,205
People on the business side who really
understand what customers need

135
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:04,985
and what opportunities are out there,

136
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,305
they can work directly with the IT people

137
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:10,586
to build solutions instead of just explaining
what they want and waiting.

138
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:13,526
And probably the most important
thing for finance,

139
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:17,425
Catalisa Studio has built-in features for
things like version control,

140
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:19,685
user permissions, and audit trails.

141
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:24,066
That's super important for making sure everything's
secure and compliant in an industry with-

142
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:24,165
Yeah.

143
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:25,005
... so many rules.

144
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,505
And the fact that they're specifically focused on
finance has got to be a huge plus, right?

145
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:29,605
Oh, yeah. For sure.

146
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:33,586
Because they only work with finance, they can
build in specific features

147
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:37,666
and deal with problems that a more general
platform might not be able to handle.

148
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:41,225
This includes stuff like meeting
regulatory requirements,

149
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:44,465
things like anti-money laundering, AML rules,

150
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,945
which stop criminals from trying to make
dirty money look clean, and

151
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:53,245
know your customer, KYC checks, which are all about
verifying who your clients actually are.

152
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:56,865
Catalisa builds all these things directly
into their building blocks,

153
00:08:57,065 --> 00:09:00,705
and they make sure security and compliance are top
priorities right from the start.

154
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:05,185
You've mentioned low-code/no-code a few times. It
seems like that's a really crucial part

155
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,925
of actually making composability work.
So, how does it do that?

156
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:13,105
Well, low-code and no-code platforms like
Catalisa Studio help business people

157
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:19,445
and tech people work together. Gartner's research on
low-code application platforms, or LCAPs,

158
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:23,665
shows just how important they're becoming. They're seeing
these platforms becoming the main development

159
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:27,525
tool for a lot of companies, even for building
really critical applications.

160
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,565
And Gartner talks about some specific
advantages of using these LCAPs, right?

161
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:34,225
Right. They point out how much
faster development

162
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:36,765
is, which we've already mentioned. But
they also say these

163
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:40,685
platforms are important for modernizing those
old legacy applications that a

164
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:43,185
lot of financial institutions are
still stuck with.

165
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:47,345
LCAPs can be a much more flexible way to
update and add to those systems.

166
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:52,385
Plus, they can be used to build applications that support
internal processes and automate things.

167
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:56,425
What's really important is that these platforms
let you build complete applications

168
00:09:56,865 --> 00:10:01,925
with user interfaces for websites and mobile apps, the
underlying logic that makes the app work,

169
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,465
and the ability to work with complex data,

170
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:08,505
often pulling from a bunch of different sources,
both inside and outside the company.

171
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:12,285
And this goes back to what Quixey was saying about
citizen developers and fusion teams, right?

172
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:13,165
Exactly.

173
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:16,645
In a composable system, these
low-code platforms

174
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:20,345
give people with deep knowledge of the business,
they call them citizen developers,

175
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:25,865
the power to actually help build and customize applications,
even if they don't know a ton about coding.

176
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:31,445
And fusion teams, which are teams made up of people
from both the business and IT sides,

177
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:34,325
can work together much better using
these visual tools.

178
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:37,325
This leads to solutions that actually fit
what the business needs.

179
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:40,825
Now, Catalisa also talks about
strategic integration

180
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,525
and how they help companies modernize
their old systems.

181
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:46,905
That seems like a big headache for a lot of
established financial institutions.

182
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:48,745
So, how does composability help with that?

183
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:51,745
This is where having a modular
approach is super helpful.

184
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:55,905
Catalisa focuses on being able to connect
existing systems with their

185
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:59,165
newer banking as a service offerings,
their building blocks,

186
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:02,785
and their ready-made solutions that
they call orchestrations.

187
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:06,925
They're basically saying, you can make everything
work together and improve efficiency

188
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:12,205
without having to do this risky and expensive thing where you
rip out all your old systems and replace them.

189
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,365
Instead, you can gradually bring in these

190
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:18,385
modern composable components and use them
alongside what you already have.

191
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,325
They also talk about refactoring legacy

192
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:26,745
systems, which means updating them to use newer technology,
but trying to keep the core functions the same,

193
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:29,025
even if the original instructions
aren't very good.

194
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:33,505
So, it's more like taking a step-by-step approach instead
of trying to change everything at once.

195
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:34,305
Exactly.

196
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:39,965
Catalisa also talks about this idea of business
testability. What do they mean by that?

197
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:43,785
This is where the flexibility of
composable business really shines.

198
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:48,745
Catalisa says you can use their platform to quickly
test out new ideas and see if they work.

199
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,105
You could do AB testing, experiment
with different workflows,

200
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:57,665
or even launch pilot programs with new features, all pretty
easily within their composable environment.

201
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,945
This lets financial institutions get
feedback quickly,

202
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:05,205
figure out what works best, and minimize risk before
they roll something out to everyone.

203
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:10,165
Because the platform is so adaptable, it's way easier to set
up these experiments and see what happens.

204
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,645
And that ability to test and adjust things

205
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:15,705
quickly must also be good for expectation
management and governance.

206
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:19,625
Yeah, definitely. Because you can test and
refine solutions so fast,

207
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:23,585
Catalisa says it lets you constantly adjust what
you're building to better meet the

208
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,925
needs and expectations of your clients.

209
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:30,525
This iterative approach makes it less likely that you'll
build something that misses the mark,

210
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,225
which means fewer governance issues and less

211
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,645
wasted time and money on redoing things.

212
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:40,725
You're basically learning and adapting as you go,
based on real data and feedback.

213
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:44,525
Okay, let's get a little more technical for a minute.
What does the Catalisa platform actually

214
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:48,225
look like? What's the structure that makes all
this composability possible?

215
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,965
So, Catalisa explains that their
architecture has multiple layers.

216
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:55,925
At the bottom, you've got the basic
infrastructure of APIs, which are

217
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,125
how different software components
talk to each other,

218
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:02,325
an API gateway, which controls and
secures access to those APIs.

219
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:07,325
Their orchestration engine, which coordinates how data and
actions flow between the building blocks,

220
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:09,745
and the user interface that
people interact with.

221
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,565
On top of that, they're building a big

222
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:17,085
ecosystem that connects banks, customers, fintech companies,
and all sorts of other service providers.

223
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:20,825
The real heart of the composability is
the composable layer,

224
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,605
which is built using low-code
and no-code tools

225
00:13:23,985 --> 00:13:28,225
and their huge library of reusable building blocks that
you can access whenever you need them.

226
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:33,225
And then they have the product API layer, which has
specific APIs for common financial services, like

227
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:38,805
loans, buy now, pay later integrations, open banking
stuff, and even blockchain features.

228
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,285
The whole architecture is designed to be
modular and adaptable

229
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:46,705
so you can create really customized solutions by
combining these different layers and components.

230
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,205
So, it's a really well-thought-out system

231
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:53,605
where composability is built in at every level.
Let's go back to Quixey for a second.

232
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:57,605
They mentioned some key reasons why businesses
should really be thinking about

233
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,665
adopting this composable approach.

234
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,285
What are some of the big ones?

235
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:06,285
One of the main reasons they give is that companies are
afraid of missing out on opportunities.

236
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,925
In today's world, where everything moves so

237
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,185
fast, companies that can't change quickly
enough to keep up with what the

238
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:14,505
market and customers want can
get left behind.

239
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:19,385
This might be because their systems are too rigid or because
it takes them forever to develop new things.

240
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:21,485
Quixey also says that companies want

241
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:26,245
to create new opportunities by taking advantage of the
flexibility that comes with a composable approach.

242
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:29,245
If you can put together and test new
offerings quickly,

243
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:32,465
you can reduce the risk that comes
with making big changes.

244
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:37,905
And lastly, they talk about the very real problem of
dealing with a constant flow of new ideas.

245
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:44,145
Traditional monolithic systems are often too slow and
clunky to keep up with all these new concepts.

246
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:47,645
Those are all really good points. Now, what
does Catalisa think the future

247
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:50,765
of banking looks like? Where do they see

248
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:54,185
this composable approach taking the industry?

249
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,545
They see a future where financial
services are basically

250
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:00,945
modular, completely integrated, and
constantly evolving.

251
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:06,705
Their goal is to be a central platform that drives innovation
and strategic agility in the financial world.

252
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:09,665
Part of this involves creating this
massive ecosystem

253
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:11,885
where all the different players, banks,

254
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:16,565
fintech companies, and other service providers can
easily share services and capabilities.

255
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:21,385
Ultimately, their big ambitious goal is to
completely change how banking works,

256
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:24,065
making it so that launching new and
innovative financial

257
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:28,045
products is as easy as putting together existing
building blocks instead of these

258
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:30,205
long, complicated development projects.

259
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:33,685
That's a bold vision. What advantages does
Catalisa think they have that

260
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,585
will help make this vision a reality?

261
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:38,195
They talk about a few things that make
them different.First,

262
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,755
they say they can innovate much
faster and reduce

263
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:45,135
operational and capital expenditures compared to
traditional software vendors.

264
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:50,015
Second, they offer specialized building blocks
designed just for the financial industry,

265
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:53,215
which makes them different from more
general low-code platforms.

266
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:56,215
Third, they have built-in security features,

267
00:15:56,335 --> 00:16:00,556
audit trails, and governance controls that are
specifically made for the strict requirements of

268
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:05,375
the financial world. And finally, they say that their
integrated approach to composability

269
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:08,575
creates more reliable and scalable solutions.

270
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:12,915
Can you give us some real-world examples of what a
financial institution could actually do

271
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:16,375
using Catalisa's platform? What kinds of
things can they do with it?

272
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:22,175
Sure. Their documentation has some good examples. One is
a complete credit pricing simulation,

273
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:26,335
which they emphasize is built entirely
using no-code orchestration.

274
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:31,455
It's designed to scale easily. You can customize it with
specific workflows for your customers,

275
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:35,755
and it can integrate with all sorts of different
channels, like mobile apps, websites, CRM

276
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,975
systems, and even older legacy systems.

277
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:42,535
They also have a personal loan API that's made
to be customizable and scalable.

278
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:48,295
Beyond specific products, they talk about being able to
achieve hyper-personalization using their APIs,

279
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:51,175
and they have features like digital
signature with multiple

280
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:54,075
signers that can integrate with different
e-signature providers.

281
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:59,875
They also mention a bunch of specific modules, like PDV
Gerencial for managing loan loss provisions,

282
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:02,615
Cálculo de Margem for calculating margins,

283
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:06,595
and different modules for things like loan
origination, Contratação,

284
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:12,415
customer relationship management, Gestão de Clientes,
credit analysis, Análise de Crédito,

285
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:16,575
electronic signature engines, Motor
de Aço Eletrônico,

286
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:19,455
document management, Gestão de Dossiers,

287
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:23,335
optical character recognition
capabilities, Motor de OCR,

288
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:28,915
and even features specifically for credit portability
in Brazil, Portabilidade de Crédito,

289
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:33,655
which includes stuff like getting consent to access
account data and doing vehicle inspections.

290
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:38,995
On top of that, they have solutions for managing partners
and sellers, controlling everything from one

291
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:40,795
place and monitoring performance,

292
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:44,815
payment authorization, which is supposed to reduce
costs and make things more secure,

293
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:49,435
customer portfolio management using predictive
analytics to create personalized campaigns,

294
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:53,975
and comprehensive risk and compliance management to make sure
everything's secure and follows the rules.

295
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:57,455
Wow, that's a lot of examples. It really gives you
a sense of how much they offer.

296
00:17:57,855 --> 00:18:03,355
So, to sum it all up, what would you say is Catalisa's main
selling point for financial institutions?

297
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:05,495
They're basically offering modular

298
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:10,755
banking as a service using these reusable building blocks.
Their main value is that they help companies

299
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:12,875
modernize their old systems quickly,

300
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,815
create brand-new financial
products and services,

301
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:19,615
save a lot of money, rely less on tech
teams for development,

302
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:23,135
and really focus on making the entire
customer experience better.

303
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:23,175
And

304
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:27,455
how does Catalisa see themselves
fitting into this whole

305
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:29,615
digital transformation that's
happening in finance?

306
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:34,755
They see themselves as providing a modern,
modular, composable alternative to those

307
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:39,615
old, inflexible legacy systems that a lot of
financial institutions are still using.

308
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:44,395
By giving them this foundation, they make it possible
to create new products quickly and

309
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:46,415
easily integrate with new technologies.

310
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,975
Ultimately, they wanna help these
companies adapt to the

311
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:51,935
constantly changing market and keep up with
what their customers want,

312
00:18:52,015 --> 00:18:54,355
so they can stay competitive in
the digital world.

313
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:58,275
So if a bank or credit union starts using
a platform like Catalisa,

314
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:02,095
what actual benefits might we see as
everyday customers?

315
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,455
It could make a big difference for customers.

316
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:09,775
We should expect things like a better overall banking
experience because they can centralize data better

317
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,395
and offer more personalized services.

318
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:15,435
Things should become faster and
more intuitive.

319
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:20,155
We should also get access to the latest technology
and financial innovations faster.

320
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:25,055
And really importantly, the underlying infrastructure
should be more secure and efficient,

321
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:28,855
which means a more trustworthy and reliable
experience for everyone.

322
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,515
Mm. Well, this has been a really fascinating look
at the world of composable business

323
00:19:32,975 --> 00:19:36,575
and how companies like Catalisa are using these
ideas in the financial world.

324
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:41,015
So, for you, our listener, what are the main
takeaways from our conversation today?

325
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:45,075
I think the most important thing is to understand that
composable business is a completely

326
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:49,235
different way of thinking about how to make
companies more adaptable and innovative.

327
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:54,415
It's about embracing modularity and building systems
using interchangeable components.

328
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:58,115
Platforms like Catalisa show how to
actually put these ideas into

329
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:01,475
practice, especially in a complicated
industry like finance.

330
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:04,335
And with low-code and no-code tools becoming

331
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:08,535
more and more common, this approach is becoming
available to more businesses,

332
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:10,415
giving them the power to react to change

333
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:14,095
quickly and create more personalized and efficient
experiences for their customers.

334
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:16,635
It really gives us a glimpse into
the future of how

335
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:20,315
services, not just in finance, will be
created and delivered.

336
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:23,475
That's a great summary. And here's
something to really think about.

337
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:29,215
We've been talking about breaking down big, complex
systems into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces.

338
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:33,775
How could you apply this same idea to other
areas of your life or work?

339
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:38,275
Could a more modular approach help you be more
flexible and efficient in what you do?

340
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:41,795
Maybe you could look into other industries
besides finance that are also

341
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:46,235
trying out these composable architectures and see what
challenges and successes they're having.

342
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:49,075
It's a concept that goes way
beyond just business.

343
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,655
Thanks for joining us for this deep dive.
